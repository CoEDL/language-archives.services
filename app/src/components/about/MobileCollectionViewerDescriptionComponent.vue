        <p>
            During the initial design conversation for the
            <router-link :to="{ path: '/about/data-loader' }">data loader</router-link>&nbsp;project
            it was decided that the proof of concept would use the
            <router-link :to="{ path: '/about/nabu-viewer' }">Nabu Viewer</router-link>&nbsp;for the display component.
        </p>
        <p>
            Built specifically for the users of Nabu, the first real world demonstrations showed that it was a poor interface for
            the largely non technical audience of a repatriation device. Specifically, the Nabu viewer interface is too text based
            and difficult to use on mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is about building a more modern, visual interface to the content installed onto a repatriation device such
            that the barrier of entry to discovery for non technical users is lowered, or even removed.
